Face detector using open cv library

 Face Detection with OpenCV

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of face detection using the OpenCV library. The project covers both static images and real-time video streams. By leveraging the Haar Cascade classifier, we identify faces and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Key Steps
1. **Importing OpenCV**: We begin by importing the OpenCV package.
2. **Reading the Image**: The input image is read.
3. **Converting to Grayscale**: Grayscale conversion enhances face detection accuracy.
4. **Loading the Classifier**: We load the Haar Cascade classifier specifically trained for face detection.
5. **Performing Face Detection**: The classifier identifies faces in the image.
6. **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes.
7. **Displaying the Processed Image**: The final result is displayed.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects. You can integrate this face detection module into applications such as security systems, video analytics, or social media filters.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (install via `pip install opencv-python`)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
